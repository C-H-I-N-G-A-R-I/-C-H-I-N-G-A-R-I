## 🔥 About Chingari

Chingari Foundation is a student-led social impact initiative built on a simple belief:

> Even a small spark of awareness and action can create meaningful change.

“Chingari” means spark — and we aim to spark awareness, safety, education, and hope within communities.

We are a youth-driven initiative focused on addressing critical social challenges such as:

- Women’s safety and empowerment  
- Child health support (including cancer awareness)  
- Education access and guidance  
- Community health awareness  
- Digital safety and cyber awareness  

While our long-term vision spans multiple areas of social welfare, we believe in starting small, focused, and sustainable — ensuring every initiative we undertake is structured, measurable, and impactful.

# 🧭 Our Core Pillars
